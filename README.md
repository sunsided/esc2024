# Eurovision Song Contest 2024 Data

For no other reason than curiosity itself, here's the point and ranking data
per country, juror and televotes.

After it was reported that the votes exhibited some odd behavior, such as some
countries obtaining an exceedingly high amount of televoting points while
having zero juror points, I figured it's interesting to have a peek at the data.

At the very least, this might be a simple dataset for others to toy around with.
